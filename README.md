## What is Data OS?

Data OS is a **single HTML file** that turns your browser into a retro terminal environment. It runs entirely client-side — no server, no install, no dependencies. Just open the file (or visit the hosted page) and you're dropped into a green-on-black MS-DOS-inspired desktop with a working terminal, a suite of built-in apps, and a collection of retro games.

Originally built to live as a Base64 data URI in a browser's address bar (to work around school `file://` restrictions), it evolved into a full featured web OS.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** `data-os.html`
2. **Open** it in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
3. You're in — the terminal boots automatically

Or boot directly into the **EZ-Mode** launcher by typing `ez-mode` in the terminal for a graphical app grid.

> No server required. No install. No dependencies. 100% client-side.

---

## Architecture

Data OS is a **single self-contained HTML file**. Everything — styles, logic, all app code, and the virtual filesystem — lives inside one file.

</div>

```
data-os.html
├── <style>          Global CSS + per-app styles (green-on-black theme)
├── Terminal engine  MS-DOS command parser + virtual filesystem
├── App system       Dynamic app loader / overlay manager
├── Apps             calc, editor, browser, paint, pixelart, music,
│                    peer, github, sysusage, ascii, base64, hacker
├── Games            pong, tetris, snake, minesweeper, breakout, 2048
└── EZ-Mode          GUI launcher overlay
```

<div align="center">

**Key design constraints:**
- Zero external dependencies (PeerJS is loaded on-demand for P2P only)
- Originally designed to fit in a browser address bar as a Base64 data URI
- All state is in-memory; refreshing resets the OS
